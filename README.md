# OTP_verifier
A simple Console app in Python, which simulates the process of OTP vertification.
I used in this project PostgreSQL DBMS, and other libraries in python for sending emails. 

## how to use it ?
0 - make an app password in your google account to give the ability to "smtplib" to access the sender account.
1 - sign up using your email
3 - if sign up worked well , then you can login again and wait for recieving an OTP in your email.
4 - OTP is expired after 5 minutes only.
